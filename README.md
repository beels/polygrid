# Polygrid

A mod to cobble together a midigrid configuration and expose it through the
normal grid API.

## Intended Usage

- Pick the midi devices to be used from the device section of the mod menu
- Assign the devices to a midigrid layout/driver
- Choose the resulting polygridN device as the first grid in the system devices
  grid menu.
- Run any script that uses a grid

None of this is implemented yet :)
